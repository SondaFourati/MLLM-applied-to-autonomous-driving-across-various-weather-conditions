## Introduction
This project explores the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in autonomous driving applications, specifically under challenging environmental conditions. By leveraging GPT-4 and the LimSim++ simulator integrated with CARLA, this project investigates how MLLMs can be applied to improve the performance of autonomous vehicles by adapting to various weather conditions using different sensor setups (e.g., front and back cameras, LiDAR).

## Project Overview
- **Objective**: To enhance autonomous driving capabilities by applying MLLMs in harsh environmental conditions.
- **Simulator**: [LimSim++](https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/LimSim) integrated with CARLA for realistic simulation environments.
- **Weather Conditions**: Tested across a range of adverse conditions (Heavy rain,fog,Storm,wetness).
- **Sensors Used**: Camera (front, back) and LiDAR for a comprehensive sensory setup.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies and tools:
- Python 3.9.0 +
- [LimSim++](https://github.com/PJLab-ADG/LimSim)
- [CARLA Simulator](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla)
- [SUMO Simulator](https://www.eclipse.org/sumo/) (for additional simulation of traffic and urban mobility)
- Additional Python packages:
